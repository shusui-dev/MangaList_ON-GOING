# MangaDex List

This is a project based on **Vite**, **React** and **TailwindCSS**, I also use **MangaDexAPI** a great API for Manga Info.

## 📌 Functionalities

- 📖 List of Top Mangas
- ⭐ classification of mangas
- 🔍 Search and filter

## 🚀 Some of the technologies I used to build this

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - a nice build tool
- [React](https://react.dev/) - a library that expands possibilities through new components
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A CSS Framework, it's my first time using it
- [MangaDex API](https://api.mangadex.org/) - Manga Data
